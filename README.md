## Outline / Notes

* My thoughts for this particular lesson
* Show them something like this:

* Potential idea for this reading. We just have them drag/drop these various UI Objects onto this screen.  
* After doing that, do have 1 question per UI object that requires them to find the answer in the documentation?  
* Another idea, is just providing links to the documentation about these various UI objects that has them read the various properties/methods associated with each one.  
* Complete reversal on what I'm thinking above. Maybe we just introduce some of these objects, but do so in a way that allows them to nest views and then in `viewDidLoad()` have them hide some of these container views so that way they see every view within it hide as well?  
* This particular reading has a pretty open outline, I'm willing to speak on any ideas or directions we could take this.
